# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer
`fetch` takes in a callback function and a URL. `fetch` then returns a promise of the `Response` object.

# Teacher Feedback

So close! `fetch` does not take in a callback function! It takes in a URL and an object that contains additional information about the request being sent, like the type of request and a body containing the information being sent over!
