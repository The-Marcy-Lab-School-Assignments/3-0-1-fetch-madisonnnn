# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - Checks if the response went through and there are no errors.

2. `Response.status` - Checks the status of the response.

3. `Response.url` - Gets the URL of the response.

4. `Response.headers` - Accesses the headers of the HTTP response.


# Teacher Feedback

There are some details missing, `.ok` will be a boolean determining whether the request was successful or not, status refers specifically to the status code returned, url is the url after any redirects and lastly headers returns metadata about the formatting of the response!
